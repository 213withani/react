# First React Web Application

## Building Product Hunt
## Simple voting app 

React approach to front end development.

## Getting started
React’s most important concepts at a high-level before diving into them in subsequent sections.

All products are sorted instantaneously by number of votes.

Node apps contain a package.json which specifies the dependencies of the project.

cd voting_app/
npm install
npm start
Browser will open to localhost:3000 and serve voting_app/index.html

For this project, we’re using Semantic UI for styling.
