React: Renders your UI and responds to events.

1. Build components, not templates

Separation of concerns: Reduce coupling, increase cohesion.

Coupling: The degree to which each program module relies on each of the other modules.

If you make a change in one place, how often do you go to another place to make it work.

Cohesion: The degree to which elements ofa. module belong together.

Is a piece of code doing too much and can you refactor.

## Display logic and markup are highly cohesive. They both show the UI.
 The JS code that drives your UI and the markup that displays it to the user are doing the same thing handling events and data to the user.
 
Templates separate technologies, not concerns.
Partial: child template.

The framework cannot know how to seprate your concerns for you. It should only provide powerful, expressive tools for the user to do it correctly.

React component: A highly cohesive building block for UIs loosely coupled with other components.

Use components to separate your concerns. With the full power of JS.
